    <h1>LONDON ARSENAL</h1>
    <br>
    <p><b>The club was founded in 1886</b> and took the name Royal Arsenal after its first game, combining the moniker of the <b>Royal Oak pub,</b> where the team members met, with that of their workplace, the Arsenal munitions factory in Woolwich. The name was changed to Woolwich Arsenal in <b>1891,</b> and Woolwich was dropped from the name after the <b> 1912–13</b> season, when the team moved its home stadium to the Highbury section of the London borough of Islington. The club played at Arsenal Stadium (commonly referred to as “Highbury”) until <b>2006</b> when it relocated to a new, <b>60,000-seat</b> stadium in Islington’s Holloway district.</p>
